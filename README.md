Determining the usefulness of the letters in the english language

First text file (smaller version of English language) taken from http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jlawler/wordlist.html

Second text file (bigger version of the English language) taken from http://www-01.sil.org/linguistics/wordlists/english/

Using the second text file and just looking for the number of duplicates that appear, we find:
English with the letter a removed has 1859 duplicates
English with the letter b removed has 989 duplicates
English with the letter c removed has 1365 duplicates
English with the letter d removed has 4286 duplicates
English with the letter e removed has 3285 duplicates
English with the letter f removed has 747 duplicates
English with the letter g removed has 1017 duplicates
English with the letter h removed has 1132 duplicates
English with the letter i removed has 1685 duplicates
English with the letter j removed has 106 duplicates
English with the letter k removed has 587 duplicates
English with the letter l removed has 3016 duplicates
English with the letter m removed has 888 duplicates
English with the letter n removed has 1661 duplicates
English with the letter o removed has 1345 duplicates
English with the letter p removed has 1613 duplicates
English with the letter q removed has 8 duplicates
English with the letter r removed has 5440 duplicates
English with the letter s removed has 28530 duplicates
English with the letter t removed has 2490 duplicates
English with the letter u removed has 871 duplicates
English with the letter v removed has 280 duplicates
English with the letter w removed has 711 duplicates
English with the letter x removed has 122 duplicates
English with the letter y removed has 1539 duplicates
English with the letter x removed has 122 duplicates

If we try replacing "q", the character with the lowest number of duplicates, with other characters, we find:
When we replace "q" with a, there are 1 duplicates.
When we replace "q" with b, there are 6 duplicates.
When we replace "q" with c, there are 5 duplicates.
When we replace "q" with d, there are 17 duplicates.
When we replace "q" with e, there are 2 duplicates.
When we replace "q" with f, there are 7 duplicates.
When we replace "q" with g, there are 10 duplicates.
When we replace "q" with h, there are 3 duplicates.
When we replace "q" with i, there are 1 duplicates.
When we replace "q" with j, there are 0 duplicates.
When we replace "q" with k, there are 3 duplicates.
When we replace "q" with l, there are 3 duplicates.
When we replace "q" with m, there are 4 duplicates.
When we replace "q" with n, there are 2 duplicates.
When we replace "q" with o, there are 1 duplicates.
When we replace "q" with p, there are 6 duplicates.
When we replace "q" with q, there are 0 duplicates.
When we replace "q" with r, there are 6 duplicates.
When we replace "q" with s, there are 13 duplicates.
When we replace "q" with t, there are 6 duplicates.
When we replace "q" with u, there are 0 duplicates.
When we replace "q" with v, there are 1 duplicates.
When we replace "q" with w, there are 2 duplicates.
When we replace "q" with x, there are 2 duplicates.
When we replace "q" with y, there are 0 duplicates.
When we replace "q" with x, there are 2 duplicates.

Which clearly means that we should remove the letter "q" from the english language and replace it with "j", "q", "u", or "y". This will make room for a more useful character, such as the spaceship Unicode character, "U+1F680", or the bath Unicode character, "U+1F6C0".
